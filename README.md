# Landing-page

Creating a landing page for a business to utilise html, CSS & flexbox skills learned throughout the odin project.

Using the 2 reference images in the example_images folders create a landing page for a business, by replicating the content, format, styles, spacing etc whilst doing everything from scratch.

Content does not need to be 1 for 1 accurate & can substitue a fake business in.
